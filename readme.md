# LiveMe Tools Web Version

This is a web-page based version of the LiveMe Tools for use on older computers or for those who want a simple desktop version.

This does NOT have a video player interface or download interface, you MUST use a plugin or 3rd party software for those features.

Development is discussed on [TheCoder's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/A5p2aF4) along with 
feedback from users.

## Getting Started
